## About The Project

**CyberBot** is an AI-powered cybersecurity assistant built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. It leverages a curated knowledge base to provide accurate, context-aware answers to cybersecurity questions. A key focus of this project is safety; the bot is engineered with strict ethical boundaries to prevent misuse and ensure it serves as a purely educational and defensive tool.

### Key Features

-   üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Educational Responses**: Provides defensive cybersecurity knowledge from a trusted and vetted set of documents.
-   üö´ **Malicious Query Blocking**: Automatically detects and blocks requests for exploits, hacking instructions, or harmful content.
-   üß† **RAG-Powered Intelligence**: Uses vector embeddings (**SentenceTransformers**) and large language models (**Hugging Face Transformers**) to generate precise, contextual answers.
-   ‚öñÔ∏è **Ethical Policy Enforcement**: Includes built-in refusal mechanisms for questions related to social engineering, exploit development, and attack anonymization.
-   üíª **Interactive Web Interface**: A clean and simple UI built with **Streamlit** for easy interaction.

## Usage

Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`. You can then type your cybersecurity questions into the chat interface.

#### Example Questions:

-   *"What is phishing and how can I protect against it?"*
-   *"Explain DDoS attacks and mitigation strategies."*
-   *"How does SIEM work for threat detection?"*
-   *"Describe the principles of the Zero Trust security model."*

## Configuration & Customization

You can easily customize CyberBot's knowledge and behavior:

-   **Expand the Knowledge Base**: Add new cybersecurity documents (in markdown or text format) to the designated `data` or `docs` folder. The RAG pipeline will automatically index them on the next run.
-   **Adjust Content Filtering**: Modify the `blocked_keywords` list within the application's code to fine-tune the bot's content safety policy.
